## ‚úÖ Assumptions

- JSON Server is hosted via Glitch and used as the mock backend.
- Login credentials are hardcoded in db.json and basic login is implemented.
- Pagination is handled entirely on the frontend.
- Focus is on form validation, clean structure, and scalability.
- The project simulates a scalable environment and could be easily swapped to use real APIs.

## üíª Live Backend API

> JSON Server is hosted here:  
**https://your-glitch-project.glitch.me**

All API calls are made to this URL from the frontend.  
Example:  
`GET https://your-glitch-project.glitch.me/test?_page=1&_limit=10`
