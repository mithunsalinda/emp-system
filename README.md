## üßæ User Stories & Acceptance Criteria
  ### üìù User Story 1: View Employee List
- Table with: First Name, Last Name, Email, Phone, Gender
- Actions: Edit & Delete buttons on each row
- Add Employee button navigates to add form

### ‚ûï User Story 2: Add Employee
- Add PRofile Picture used base64 to store in the db.json
- First Name (6‚Äì10 characters)
- Last Name (6‚Äì10 characters)
- Email (valid format)
- Phone (valid SG number)
- Gender (radio group)
- DOB Date (must be ‚â•18 years old)
- Validations with real-time feedback
- Highlights errors with red border and message

### ‚úèÔ∏è User Story 3: Edit Employee
- Edit button navigates to prefilled form
- Same validation rules as add
- Unsaved changes trigger warning modal I used a JavaScript modal to do that. There is an issue when I try to integrate it with the Ant Design modal. For the time being, I'm using it as is and need some time to sort it out.

### üóëÔ∏è User Story 4: Delete Employee
- Confirmation modal on delete
- Record is removed and table is refreshed

‚ö†Ô∏è Error Handling
- API errors (add/edit/delete) are gracefully handled with user-friendly error messages. in api-common.ts i have added Server error messages.


## üíª Live Backend API

> JSON Server is hosted here:  
**https://glitch.com/edit/#!/silky-wakeful-fifth?path=README.md%3A1%3A0**

All API calls are made to this URL from the frontend.  
Example:  
`GET https://your-glitch-project.glitch.me/test?_page=1&_limit=10`
